I am a Dedicated Technologist with over 10 years of professional experience in business and team management. I am a veteran with military and business leadership training, a diploma in Computer Science and Full Stack Web Development from Atlas Tulsa (formerly Holberton) and a Bachelor's in Science from Oklahoma State University.

I am happiest in a role where I am constantly adding new skills that help me to solve technical and strategic challenges for brands, businesses, and my team. I have been very fortunate to work with artists and music industry professionals on tech solutions that seek to build cultural infrastructure for local music and the arts and am excited to continue my work there while branching to other exciting fields. As co-creator of musicintulsa.com, already the most complete directory of bands and musicians in the Tulsa area with a continually growing database.I am a Dedicated Technologist with over 10 years of professional experience in business and team management.
